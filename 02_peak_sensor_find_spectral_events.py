    # SPECTRALEVENTS_FIND Algorithm for finding and calculating spectral 
    #   events on a trial-by-trial basis of of a single subject/session. Uses 
    #   one of three methods before further analyzing and organizing event 
    #   features:
    #
    #   1) (Primary event detection method in Shin et al. eLife 2017): Find 
    #      spectral events by first retrieving all local maxima in 
    #      un-normalized TFR using imregionalmax, then selecting suprathreshold
    #      peaks within the frequency band of interest. This method allows for 
    #      multiple, overlapping events to occur in a given suprathreshold 
    #      region and does not guarantee the presence of within-band, 
    #      suprathreshold activity in any given trial will render an event.
    #   2) Find spectral events by first thresholding
    #      entire normalize TFR (over all frequencies), then finding local 
    #      maxima. Discard those of lesser magnitude in each suprathreshold 
    #      region, respectively, s.t. only the greatest local maximum in each 
    #      region survives (when more than one local maxima in a region have 
    #      the same greatest value, their respective event timing, freq. 
    #      location, and boundaries at full-width half-max are calculated 
    #      separately and averaged). This method does not allow for overlapping
    #      events to occur in a given suprathreshold region and does not 
    #      guarantee the presence of within-band, suprathreshold activity in 
    #      any given trial will render an event.
    #   3) Find spectral events by first thresholding 
    #      normalized TFR in frequency band of interest, then finding local 
    #      maxima. Discard those of lesser magnitude in each suprathreshold region,
    #      respectively, s.t. only the greatest local maximum in each region

    #      boundaries at full-width half-max are calculated separately and 
    #      averaged). This method does not allow for overlapping events to occur in
    #      a given suprathreshold region and ensures the presence of 
    #      within-band, suprathreshold activity in any given trial will render 
    #      an event.

    # Inputs:
    #   findMethod - integer value specifying which event-finding method 
    #       function to run. Note that the method specifies how much overlap 
    #       exists between events.
    #   eventBand - range of frequencies ([Fmin_event Fmax_event]; Hz) over 
    #       which above-threshold spectral power events are classified.
    #   thrFOM - factors of median threshold; positive real number used to
    #       threshold local maxima and classify events (see Shin et al. eLife 
    #       2017 for discussion concerning this value).
    #   tVec - time vector (s) over which the time-frequency response (TFR) is 
    #       calcuated.
    #   fVec - frequency vector (Hz) over which the time-frequency response 
    #       (TFR) is calcuated.
    #   TFR - time-frequency response (TFR) (trial-frequency-time) for a
    #       single subject/session.
    #   classLabels - numeric or logical 1-row array of trial classification 
    #       labels; associates each trial of the given subject/session to an 
    #       experimental condition/outcome/state (e.g., hit or miss, detect or 
    #       non-detect, attend-to or attend away).
